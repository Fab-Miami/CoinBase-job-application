# üöÄ Coinbase Job Applicator

Welcome to the "I Really, Really Want to Work at Coinbase" script!
If like me you notice CoinBase has hundreds of job that matches your profile, and you want to apply to all of them, here is the solution i came up with.
This small Python thing is designed to streamline your job application process at Coinbase, because manually filling out forms is so 2010.

## ü§ñ What This Script Does

This script is your personal job application assistant. It's like having a very enthusiastic friend who really wants you to work at Coinbase, but doesn't get tired or make typos. Here's what it does:

1. Fills out job applications faster than you can say "blockchain"
2. Uploads your resume and cover letter (because who doesn't love a good cover letter?)
3. Answers all those pesky questions about your experience with Coinbase products
4. Handles both single URL applications and bulk applications from a list
5. Gives you a chance to review before submitting, in case you want to add a joke or two

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you embark on this automated job-seeking adventure, make sure you have:

- Python (preferably a version that's not old enough to apply for jobs itself)
- Selenium (because we're not savages who manually click buttons)
- ChromeDriver (make sure it's the right version, or things get weird)
- A burning desire to work at Coinbase (optional, but recommended)

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Clone this repo (or just copy-paste the code, we won't judge)
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install selenium webdriver_manager
   ```
3. Update the constants at the top of the script with your info (unless your name is actually Fabrice Colozzi, in which case, hi Fabrice!)
4. Run the script:
   ```
   python coinbase_applicator.py
   ```
5. Choose your mode:
   - "One by one URL mode" for when you're feeling picky
   - "URL list mode" for when you're feeling ambitious

## üé≠ Features

- **Two Exciting Modes**: Choose between applying to jobs one at a time (for the cautious) or in bulk (for the brave).
- **Automatic Form Filling**: Because filling out form for the 100th time is nobody's idea of fun (even with browther prefill, trus me).
- **Resume and Cover Letter Upload**: Automatically uploads your documents, saving you precious seconds you could spend dreaming about your future Coinbase job.
- **Smart Dropdown Handling**: It selects options from dropdowns like a pro. It's basically a sommelier, but for job applications.
- **Duplicate Job ID Check**: Prevents you from accidentally applying to the same job twice, because enthusiasm is good, but desperation is not.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This script is for educational purposes only. Please use responsibly and in accordance with Coinbase's application policies. I am not responsible if you end up with 50 job offers and can't decide which one to take.

## ü§î FAQs

Q: Will this guarantee me a job at Coinbase?
